    Industry has a particular responsibility to shape the transformation from our current economy into an ecologically and socially sustainable one. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates how unexpected events can disrupt entire global logistics chains in short time. The resulting demand for change, combining sustainability and resilience aspects, poses enormous challenges for industrial production. At the same time, the ongoing digitalization and networking of industrial value chains – summarized as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 – offer new opportunities and capabilities to reach these objectives. We see sustainability as a driver of structural change: In parallel to our current digital transformation, we need a sustainability transformation of today’s value creation and production models into future-proof resilient approaches.

<p>
    The objective of this minitrack is to foster a discussion how new information & communication systems can foster sustainability and resilience in the next generation of production systems. Data-enriched views on processes and an increasing information capability (in real-time, complete, distributed) are the underlying principles of improving the efficiency of processes and avoiding waste over the complete life cycle of products and industrial assets. A main enabler in this regard is cross-company data spaces. They link classic “data silos” even across company boundaries. Supported by a combination of optimization, simulation, artificial intelligence and machine learning, new insights can be created.
</p>

<p>
    In this minitrack, we aim to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss novel approaches in dealing with sustainability through resilient information systems and connected data spaces. Particularly, we invite submissions that discuss cross-organizational aspects of data sharing, e.g., to enable analyzing issues of sustainability and resilience across entire value chains. Areas of focus and interest of this minitrack include, but are not limited to:
